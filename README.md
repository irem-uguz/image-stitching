# image-stitching
Image stitching to create a panaromic mosaic written on Python

In this project, homography matrix between two images is calculated and two images stitched together to create a mosaic. The results are not perfect yet and needs improvement. The project is written on Python and uses Numpy so please install it before running the project. Detailed explanation on the results can found on report. The data points that are experimented on are in the code files. The system takes the corresponding points of two images from user input.

The code documentation is on a bad state :( I am planning to fix it soon.

The project is done for CMPE537 on Fall 2019
